  <h1>☵ Water quality</h1>
  <p>Water contamination remains one of the most pervasive environmental health threats, with common contaminants including heavy metals, disinfection byproducts, microbial pathogens, pesticides, and more.</p>
  <p>Exposure to heavy metals is linked to neurodevelopmental impairments, kidney dysfunction, and increased carcinogenic risk (WHO, 2017; Lanphear et al., 2018). Microbial pathogens can cause acute gastrointestinal illnesses (CDC, 2024). Disinfection byproducts, such as trihalomethanes (THMs) arising from chemical treatment of water, have been associated with developmental issues (Grazuleviciene, 2011) and more.</p>
  <p>While research on complex mixture effects and low-dose chronic exposures continues to evolve, the precautionary principle supports implementing robust filtration systems capable of addressing multiple contaminant classes simultaneously.</p>
  <p>For citations and details on these health effects and additional information, please see the accompanying Evaluation Standards document.</p>

    <h2>Drinking Water</h2>
    <p>Drinking water quality: Optimal. Your filtration system is working well, and your drinking water is excellent. Additionally, your water has lower mineral content than is optimal.</p>
    
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Contributors to Drinking water quality</th><th></th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><th>Category</th><th>Categorization</th></tr>
        <tr><td>metals/inorganics</td><td>Optimal</td></tr><tr><td>moderately volatile organics</td><td>Optimal</td></tr><tr><td>special cases (microbial, physical, etc.)</td><td>Optimal</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In the table below, you can see the levels of orally ingested contaminants we detected, compared to the Health Guidance Level (HGL) — the most protective benchmark published by public health agencies.</p>
    <p>No drinking contaminants exceeded their health guidance levels.</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Category</th><th>Amount (PPM)</th><th>Recommendation</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>Calcium</td><td>Minerals</td><td>47.30</td><td>A minimum of ~20 PPM, with an optimum of c.40–80 PPM.</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium</td><td>Minerals</td><td>4.42</td><td>A minimum of ~10 PPM and an optimum of c.20–30 PPM.</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Refer to the appendix for additional information on the health risks from metals and minerals discussed above.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Bathing Water</h2>
    <p>Bathing water quality: Moderate. Your shower water contains elevated levels of highly volatile organic compounds. These are primarily Conductivity and Total THMs, which can pose health risks through inhalation and skin absorption.</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Contributors to Other water quality</th><th></th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><th>Category</th><th>Categorization</th></tr>
        <tr><td>highly volatile organics</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>moderately volatile organics</td><td>Optimal</td></tr><tr><td>semi-volatile/lipophilic organics</td><td>Optimal</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Category</th><th>Reading (PPB)</th><th>Comparison to HGL</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>Conductivity</td><td>special cases</td><td>439.1</td><td>No safe level</td></tr><tr><td>Total THMs</td><td>highly volatile organics</td><td>8.55</td><td>+2,572%</td></tr><tr><td>Chloroform</td><td>highly volatile organics</td><td>6.27</td><td>+2,750%</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In the table above, you'll see the contaminants most likely to be inhaled or absorbed through skin contact, along with how they compare to the HGL benchmarks. Showering in water containing elevated THMs has been linked to increased cancer risk, reproductive issues, and damage to the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system due to inhalation and dermal absorption.</p>

<section><h3>Drinking water optimization options</h3><ul><li><strong>- [ ] Option 1: Add a remineralisation stage to your current drinking water filtration system</strong><br />Depending on your system’s setup, we can add an additional remineralisation stage to reintroduce beneficial minerals into the filtered water. Let us know if you’d like to address this and we can provide some options. Note that adding trace-mineral drops is another option, but we have not found a brand with fully clean test results.</li><li><strong>- [ ] Option 2: Opt for spring water delivery</strong><br />Water delivery services provide naturally mineralized, clean water in 2.5 or 5-gallon glass jugs. We recommend Alive Waters or Mountain Valley’s home delivery service.</li></ul></section>
<section><h3>Bathing water remediation options</h3><ul><li><strong>- [ ] Option 1: Install a whole-home two-stage filtration system for full protection</strong><br />We recommend systems like the Springwell Whole House Water Filter System, which will effectively remove the THMs present in your water. This provides comprehensive protection for all water sources, including showers and bathroom taps, but comes with a higher upfront cost and installation complexity.</li><li><strong>- [ ] Option 2: Install shower filters for partial protection</strong><br />This provides partial protection because it addresses shower water exposure while leaving other taps unfiltered. However, the majority of THM consumption comes in the shower, so it will make a significant difference. We recommend the Pristine Hydro Ultimate Dual KDF Shower Filter.</li></ul></section>
